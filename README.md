# ExceptionHandler
A x86-32 only (for now) exception handler project that is able to record in-depth crash logs on end user systems
In some cases, this is able to record a call stack more intact than Visual Studio (albeit not 100% of the time,) so it is useful as a debugging tool as well.

Some parts of this are incomplete but the project is functional.
